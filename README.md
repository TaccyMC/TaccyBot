The general discord bot for moderation, adding of roles, user levels and basic commands. The bot is build using modern discord features like slash commands and buttons, allowing for easy and simple user interaction. 

Currently, the bot is designed to operate in a single discord server with one group of members and there is no intent in the near future to expand support to multiple servers with just one bot client.
